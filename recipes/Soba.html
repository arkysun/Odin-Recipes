    <p><h1>Soba Noodles</h1></p>

    <p><h1>The background of this summer dish</h1></p>
    <p>In Japan, where it gets plenty hot in the summer, cold soba noodles, served with a dipping sauce, are a common snack or light meal. Soba are brown noodles, made from wheat and buckwheat, and the sauce is based on dashi, the omnipresent Japanese stock.</p>

    <p>You would recognize the smell of dashi in an instant, even if you have never knowingly eaten it. It's a brilliant concoction based on kelp, a seaweed and dried bonito flakes. It is also among the fastest and easiest stocks you can make, and its two main ingredients – which you can buy in any store specializing in Asian foods – keep indefinitely in your pantry. I would encourage you to try making it, though you can also use chicken stock (or instant dashi, which is sold in the same stores)</p>

    <p><h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 cup dashi</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
            <li>8 ounces soba noodles</li>
            <li>  Finely grated or minced ginger</li>
            <li>  Finely sliced scallions</li>
        </ul>

    <p><h2><u>Steps to prepare</u></h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt it. Cook noodles until tender but not mushy. Drain, and quickly rinse under cold running water until cold. Drain well.</li> 
            <li>Combine dashi or stock, soy sauce and mirin. Taste, and add a little more soy if the flavor is not strong enough. Serve noodles with garnishes, with sauce on side for dipping (or spooning over).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The soba noodles need to be really cold. Prior to cooking the noodles have a large bowl of ice water handy, with plenty of ice. Once the noodles are to taste, quickly drain and plunge into the ice water. Work by hand until the noodles are ice cold, then drain thoroughly and serve immediately.</p>

        <p>Thanks Mr. Bittman, these noodles were great with beautiful North Fork L. I . sliced radishes, cukes, scallions, and shredded carrots mixed in, topped with sliced poached chicken breast and sauce. A wonderful, light summer supper.</p>

        <p>Pretty awful representation of Japanese culture in my opinion. You're also supposed to put the noodles into the soup and add garnishes such as finely sliced scallion, nori and finely slice omelette. This recipe is as white as the people above who reviewed them. 2/5 stars.</p>
